- General notes: 
    - The Binance API endpoint is https://data-api.binance.vision/api/v3/ticker/24hr, not https://data.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr as specified in the assignment document.

- Enhancements:
    - Refresh token implementation is pending.
    - Improved user interface is needed.
    - A date selector was implemented on the weather page but removed due to slow API response times when a date is specified.
    - Public APIs should be proxied through the backend, potentially with Redis caching.
    - Additional testing and improved error handling are required.
