- General notes: 
    - The Binance API endpoint is https://data-api.binance.vision/api/v3/ticker/24hr, not https://data.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr as specified in the assignment document.
    - The symbols provided here are not standardized. Prices are quoted against various cryptocurrencies instead of a common standard like USD. Currently, the symbols will remain as they are. Please reach out if a different handling approach is required.

- Enhancements:
    - Refresh token implementation is pending.
    - Improved user interface is needed.
    - A date selector was implemented on the weather page but removed due to slow API response times when a date is specified.
    - Public APIs should be proxied through the backend, potentially with Redis caching.
    - Additional testing and improved error handling are required.
    - There are occasional issues with the Google token exchange, particularly related to time synchronization. This occurs infrequently.
